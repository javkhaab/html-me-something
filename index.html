            <p>Last march 2018 me and my two other friends did a road trip to west coast, starting from St. Louis to San Franciso.</p>

                    <h1>Grand Canyon, AZ</h1>
                    <p>We didn't expect this big canyon in front of us. When we got there it was cloudy and snowing so hard. We thought that we came in wrong day with wrong weather, but about an hour everything cleared up and we've enjoyed the beatiful view of Grand Canyon</p>

                        <h1>Santa Curz, CA</h1>
                        <p>It was relatively small town compared to San Francisco and other cities. We visited one of our friends there. There is a Mongolian restaurant in town so we had some Mongolian dinner at the end of night. It was fun.

                        <h1>San Francisco, CA</h1>
                        <p>It was a great experience. I think it was one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited. The most beatufil sunset I've ever seen was at the beach of San Francsico.

                        <h1>Las Vegas, NV</h1>
                        <p>I have never been to Las Vegas before. It was full of tourists and entertainment places for them. All kinds of shows, bars, casinos were all over Las Vegas.

                        <h1>Denver, CO</h1>
                        <p>Visited Denver while we were going back to St. Louis, MO. I enjoyed the beatiful nature of Colorado pretty much.
